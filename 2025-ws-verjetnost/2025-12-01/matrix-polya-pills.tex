\section{Exercise (expected value, method of indicators): A variant on the blue and red pills}

(Adapted from Stirzaker, Probability and Random Variables, Chapter 5, ex. 11)

In the movie the Matrix, the character Morpheus offers another character Neo two pills. If Neo chooses the blue pill, he will return to his old life. If he chooses the red one, his eyes will be opened to some truth, and he will join Morpheus' band.

In this variant (also of Pólyeva's urn, see MR, vaja 4), Neo has to choose blindly from a bucket initially containing one red and one blue pill. If he picks red, he must swallow it and the game is over. If he picks blue, then he returns the blue pill and Morpheus adds an extra red pill.


Let $X$ be the number of draws. Calculate

\begin{enumerate}
\item The distribution $P(X>k)$
\item $\text{E}(X)$ (hint: use the method of indicators)
\end{enumerate}
