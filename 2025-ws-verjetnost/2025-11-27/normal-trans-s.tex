\subsubsection*{A solution}

Let $z = x/5 - 9/5$. Then $Z \sim N(9/5 - 9/5, 25/25) = N(0, 1)$.

We calculate next, using $X = 5Z + 9$:
\begin{align*}
P(X \leq 0) &= P(5 Z + 9 \leq 0) \\
&= P(Z \leq -9/5) \\
&= \Phi(-9/5) \text{ by } Z\sim N(0,1) \text{ and definition of } \Phi\\
&= 1 - \Phi(9/5) \text{\, by symmetry of } \Phi
\end{align*}

where the symmetry of $\Phi$ property was used already in lectures.
