\subsection{Exercise, hat (or jacket check) problem}

$n$ visitors to the Komische Opera (`funny opera') in Berlin all check in black, Jack Wolfskin jackets before a performance of Mozart's Don Giovanni. When they come to pick up their jackets after the performance, with uniform probability, the coat check clerk gives them a random black, Jack Wolfskin jacket.

Let $X$ be the random variable defined as the number of visitors who get the correct jacket back, so $X \in \{0, \ldots, n\}$.

On average, how many visitors do we expect to get back their own jacket?

\smallskip

\emph{Hint:} Use indicator functions / variables, and expected value.

\emph{Cultural side notes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I may have seen Ralf Fiennes, of Harry Potter Voldemort and English Gardner fame, waiting for a performance of Don Giovanni to start in Berlin back in 2008.
\item A large proportion of Germans wear black, Jack Wolfskin jackets. After a work party once when I went to pick up my jacket, I jokingly tried to help the coat clerk by telling her that mine was the black, Jack Wolfskin jacket.
\end{enumerate}
