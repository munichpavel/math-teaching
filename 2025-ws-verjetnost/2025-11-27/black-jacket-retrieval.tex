\subsection{Exercise, hat (or jacket check) problem}

$n$ visitors to a museum in Berlin all check in black, Jack Wolfskin jackets upon arrival before 6pm. When they come to pick up their jackets later in the evening around 8pm, with uniform probability, the coat check clerk gives them a random black, Jack Wolfskin jacket.

Let $X$ be the random variable defined as the number of visitors who get the correct jacket back, so $X \in \{0, \ldots, n\}$.

On average, how many visitors do we expect to get back their own jacket?

\emph{Hint:} Use indicator functions / variables, and expected value.
