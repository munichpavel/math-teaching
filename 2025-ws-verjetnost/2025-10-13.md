## Background

### Definition of a probability space

Let $\Omega$ be a set, $\mathcal{F}$ a $\sigma$-algebra of $\Omega$. Then $P: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a **probability** if

1. $P(\empty) = 0$,
1. $P(\Omega) = 1$, and
1. If $A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{F}$ satisfy $A_i \cap A_j$ for all $i \neq j$, then $P$ satisfies

$$
P(\cup_i A_i) = \sum_i P(A_i)
$$

### Lemma

Let (*Naj bodo*) $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space (*vernetnoski prostor*), and let (*naj bodo*) $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$ be arbitrary events (*poljubni dogodki*). Then (*Velja*)

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

### Alternative notation

If we take a typical example of an urn containing white and black balls, with a person drawing from the urn (potentially with or without replacement), then the usual notation for representing a white or black draw on the $i^{th}$ try is

$$
B_i = \{ \mathrm{draw\,} i \mathrm{\,is\,black}\}
$$

and
$$
W_i = \{ \mathrm{draw\,} i \mathrm{\,is\,white}\}
$$

A more verbose notation that I find a bit clearer with respect to what is actually going on would be to let $D$ be the event of drawing a ball, then writing

$$
\{V_i = \mathrm{black}\}
$$

for $B_i$ and

$$
\{V_j = \mathrm{white}\}
$$

for $W_j$.

The first notation choice is more common. We introduce the second in case it gives you greater clarity of thought, as it does for me.
