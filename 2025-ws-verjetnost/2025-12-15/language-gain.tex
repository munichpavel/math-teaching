\section{Exercise: language gains (discrete multivariable, marginal, independence)}

Assume we are given data from several years of participants in an intensive language program.
At the beginning of each course, students are assessed for their starting level, and given a proficiency score on a scale from 1 to $N$. In reality, one scale with $N=4$ is Novice, Intermediate, Advanced or Superior, while there is a finer grained version of this scale with $N=10$ grades (low, intermediate and high for all but superior): \href{https://www.languagetesting.com/actfl-proficiency-scale}{https://www.languagetesting.com/actfl-proficiency-scale}.
At the end, the assessment is make again.
Per participant, the initial and final assessments are recorded.

Let $X$ be the random variable corresponding to a randomly chosen student's start level.
$X$ takes values $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, N\}$, defined in bijection with the 4 ordered proficiency levels.

Similarly, let $Y$ be the random variable corresponding to a randomly chosen student's level at the end of the program, again taking values in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$.

Assume we have estimated from the data that the probability distribution function of $(X, Y)$ is

\begin{equation*}
P(X=k, Y=\ell) =
    \begin{cases}
        c \cdot (2\ell - k) \quad \text{ if }\ell \geq k \\
        c & \quad \text{ otherwise,}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the constant $c$.
\item Calculate $P(Y=k+1 | X=k)$.
\item Given the following plot of $P(Y=k+1 | X=k)$

Does this model give evidence for or against the inverted pyramid model from \href{https://www.languagetesting.com/actfl-proficiency-scale}{https://www.languagetesting.com/actfl-proficiency-scale}?
